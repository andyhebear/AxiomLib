The Axiom.SoundSystems plugin for Axiom is a sound library that supports Xna and OpenAL sound replay, providing a general interface for those subsystems.


We're using the following libraries:

Axiom 3D rendering engine - http://www.axiom3d.net
Microsoft Xna Framework - http://www.xna.com
OpenAL - http://www.openal.org
Tao Framework bindings - http://www.taoframework.com
Mp3Sharp managed mp3 decoder - http://www.robburke.net/mle/mp3sharp/
CSVorbis, C# port of Jorbis - http://www.monoproject.com

The sound media files originate from http://www.freesound.org and are licensed under the Creative Commons Sampling Plus1 1.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/


TODO: 

- Test on Linux, Xbox, Zune

- Consider how to utilize/learn from the irrKlang sound library http://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/ (that one is free for non-commercial use only)
